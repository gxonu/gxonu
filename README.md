## 👋 About me?

I'm a highly motivated AI researcher pursuing excellence in Generative AI and Multimodal Learning. My goal is to develop cutting-edge technologies that make meaningful contributions to society and advance the field of AI.

I am deeply interested in AI research, particularly in **Generative Models**, **Multimodal Learning**, and **Computer Vision**. Currently, I'm working as an undergraduate research intern at **KAIST AI Graduate School**, focusing on video generation research. With hands-on experience in building AI systems from problem definition to deployment, I aim to bridge the gap between academic research and real-world applications.
